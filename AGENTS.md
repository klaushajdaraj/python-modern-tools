# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This is a Python package laid out with a `src/`-based import path and supporting tooling for docs and scripts.
- `src/{{project_slug_underscore}}/` contains the package code (for example `src/{{project_slug_underscore}}/main.py`).
- `tests/` holds the test suite collected by pytest.
- `scripts/` contains helper scripts called by the `justfile`.
- `docs/` stores documentation sources; `mkdocs.yml` configures the site.
- `playground/` contains Marimo notebooks.
- `pyproject.toml` and `justfile` define tooling, dependencies, and tasks.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use `uv` for dependency management and to run tools.
- `just install` installs and synchronizes dev dependencies.
- `just lint` runs Ruff linting and formatting.
- `just tests` runs `uv run pytest -v` and cleans `__pycache__` files.
- `just build` runs the build script.
- `just init-docs` initializes the docs branch; `just github-pages` publishes docs.
- `just docker-build` builds the Docker image.
- `uv run marimo edit` opens the Marimo notebook editor in `playground/`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow standard Python conventions and keep code docstring-friendly for generated docs.
- Indentation is 4 spaces, no tabs.
- Use `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes, and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Prefer type hints on public APIs; keep docstrings up to date for `mkdocstrings`.
- Run `just lint` before opening a pull request.

## Testing Guidelines
Pytest is configured in `pyproject.toml` with coverage for `src/` and JUnit/coverage outputs.
- Place tests in `tests/` and name files `test_*.py`.
- Both pytest and unittest styles are acceptable (pytest will collect both).
- Run tests with `just tests`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Git history is not available in this workspace, so no existing commit convention can be summarized here.
- If you use Commitizen, run `cz` to format commits consistently.
- Pull requests should include a concise summary, test results, and any doc updates.
- Add screenshots for documentation or UI-facing changes when relevant.

## Documentation & Configuration Notes
- Python `>=3.13` is required; `uv` `>=0.8.0` is expected.
- Documentation is generated from docstrings; keep public APIs documented.
